## How to Use Tagaroth

This is a small tutorial on how to use Tagaroth.
You need this before usage of any Tagaroth commands.

`const tagaroth = require('tagaroth.js')`

You can use any Tagaroth command below this. But all commands must start with tagaroth.{commandName}
If you don't, you will get an error in the console.

That is all you need to know to use tagaroth.js
Have fun!
